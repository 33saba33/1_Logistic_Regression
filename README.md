# Breast Cancer Classification using Logistic Regression

This project implements logistic regression from scratch to classify tumors as malignant or benign based on their features.  
The goal is to learn and practice more Machine Learning concepts without using high-level libraries.

## How to Run

- Install the required libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`.
- Open the `Cancer_logistic_regression.ipynb` notebook.
- Run all the cells to train the model and visualize the results.

## Dataset

- The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.
- It can be found www.kaggle.com

## Results

- The model reaches over **95% test accuracy** after training.
- Training progress and cost evolution are displayed in plots at the end.

## Notes

- We implemented the logistic regression algorithm manually.
- Weights and bias were initialized to zeros.
- This project is part of my learning journey. I am open to any feedback, suggestions, or advice to improve my work.
